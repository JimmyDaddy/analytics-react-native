A React Native client for [Segment](https://segment.com) â€” The hassle-free way to integrate analytics into any application.

This library is based on its node counterpart, [analytics-node](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-node), and despite being designed to run on react-native, also will work in browsers and even nodejs, you only need to include [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) for browsers or [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) for nodejs or io.js.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install analytics-react-native
```
